# Nightreign Overlay ‚Äî Seed Finder + In‚ÄëGame Overlay

An Electron-based **seed finder** and **overlay** for *Elden Ring Nightreign*. It lets you quickly narrow seeds/patterns and renders labels on top of the game‚Äôs map.

---

## Highlights

- üîé **Seed Finder**: fast pruning with slot icons (Spawn / Churches / Sorcerer‚Äôs Rise / Township, etc.), per‚Äëslot pickers, and smart ‚Äúghost‚Äù hints when only two options remain.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Overlay**: transparent, always‚Äëon‚Äëtop; category toggles, per‚Äëcategory colors, font size / scale, global offset.
- üéÆ **Controller support**: DualSense **and** Xbox .
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Hotkeys**: F7‚ÄìF10 by default, fully customizable (UI or `config/hotkeys.json`).
- üåê **Languages**: per‚Äëlanguage JSON bundles (UI + domain labels).
- üîí **Safe with EAC**: never touches the game process; just keyboard/gamepad input and an overlay window.
- üß© **Deep of the Night mode friendly**: when POIs are hidden in‚Äëgame, you can still identify the seed by placing your **Spawn** and other early visibile icons.

## Using Seed Finder

1. **Open Seed Finder** and bring it into focus (F7) and choose a **Shifting Earth** type (you can click the buttons in the side bar or the thumbnails).
2. Click icons on the map to **pick per‚Äëslot** values (Spawn, Churches, Township, etc.).  
   - The slot picker appears on click; unavailable/invalid options are hidden.  
   - If the logic narrows to two options and one is empty, you‚Äôll see a **ghost icon** on the map as a hint.
3. Continue placing icons until the **candidate count** converges.
4. When one seed is left it will automatically display.

### Deep of the Night (hidden POIs)
When the game hides POIs, you can still narrow the seed by setting **Spawn** (in cases where you spawn at a church use the **Church Spawn** combined icon). Supplement with other early POIs to narrow down your seed.

---

### POI Settings (visibility + color)
In **Seed Finder ‚Üí Overlay Options ‚Üí POI Settings** you can toggle categories and pick colors:
- Night Bosses, Evergaol, Field Boss, Events, Sorcerer‚Äôs Rise, Castle, Ruins, Great Churches, Churches, Townships, Forts, Camps, Caravans.

Each category has an independent color swatch.

### Overlay Settings
Also under **Overlay Options**:
- **Font Size** ‚Äî label font size.  
- **Offset X / Offset Y** ‚Äî nudges every label globally (useful for personal HUD layouts).  
- **Scale** ‚Äî scales label size and paddings (DPI‚Äëaware).

> All settings persist on restart.

## Languages & Translations
  
- Some phrasing may be off. Please open an issue if you find an error so I can update it.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Overlay doesn‚Äôt appear**  
  - If you have multiple monitors, the overlay attaches to your **primary display**. Move the game window there or change the primary monitor.
- **Hotkey doesn‚Äôt work**  
  - Another app may have registered that global shortcut. Change your hotkey in **Hotkey Settings**.
- **Controller toggle doesn‚Äôt work**  
  - Disable or reconfigure **Steam Input** so the pad reports standard buttons.
- **Wrong language/labels**  
  - Switch language in the Finder dropdown.

---

## Safety

- Runs as a normal desktop app.  
- No game memory reads/writes, no DLL injection, no kernel drivers.  
- Safe to use with **Easy Anti‚ÄëCheat enabled**.
- Still use at your own risk.
